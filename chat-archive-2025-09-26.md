***

User: Create a new file called chat-archive-2025-09-26.md in the main branch of the repository markeldeiry/master-source. The file should contain the entire content of this chat session, formatted as discussed. Use *** as the section separators instead of ---. Include a clear New York time (EDT) timestamp for the archive, and ensure the file is Markdown formatted for easy copy-paste into the master document later.

Assistant: To create the file `chat-archive-2025-09-26.md` in the `markeldeiry/master-source` repository, I will include the content of our chat session formatted in Markdown with section separators as requested.
